# ETL-Pipeline-Project

This project implements an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline designed to process data from various sources, perform transformations, and load the cleaned data into a target system (e.g., a database or data warehouse). The pipeline is built using Python and leverages libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation.

SETUP ON LOCAL SYSTEM
1. Clone the github repo into your local system: git clone https://github.com/Git-VivanX/ETL-Pipeline-Project.git
2. Download and set-up virtual environment using command: python3 -m venv venv(for mac) and python -m vevn venv
                                                          source venv/bin/activate
3. Run the backend in the terminal using the command: node server.js
4. Run the frontend using the command: python3 -m http.server 8000
5. The code should be running on the link provided after starting the frontend.
